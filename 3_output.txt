literature. Szabo (1997) introduced the concept of “Smart
Contracts”, which combine computer protocols with user
interfaces to execute the terms of a contract Due to the
blockchain, Smart Contracts are becoming more popular
since they can be utilized more easily by applying block-
chains in comparison to the technology available at the
time of their invention 20 years ago. This innovative
approach might, for example, replace lawyers and banks
that have been involved in contracts for asset deals
depending on predeﬁned aspects (Fairﬁeld 2014). Smart
Contracts can also be used to control the ownership of
properties. These properties might be tangible (e.g., houses,
automobiles) or intangible (e.g., shares, access rights). A
prominent example for blockchain technology that treats
smart contracts as ﬁrst class citizens is Ethereum, which is
a decentralized system originally proposed by Buterin
(2014). A taxonomy of decentralised consensus systems
and an overview of different types of systems is provided

by Glaser and Bezzenberger (2015). Ethereum can be seen
as an extension of the Bitcoin blockchain to support a
broader scope of applications. Thus, blockchain technology
allows to establish contracts using cryptography and to
replace third parties (e.g., a notary) that have been neces-
sary to establish trust in the past. Blockchain might disrupt
the entire transaction process by automatically executing
contracts in a cost-effective, transparent and secure manner
(Fairﬁeld 2014). The architectural components of block-
chain technology, their interaction as well as a framework
for implication analysis of blockchain systems for digital
ecosystems is proposed by Glaser (2017).

The ﬁnancial industry is even wondering if large parts
of their current business might be replaced by the
blockchain. This can be illustrated by the payment pro-
cess. If people pay goods by credit card today, the set-
tlement occurs after a delay of several days. Utilizing the
blockchain, this delayed settlement would become
