redundant since payment can be done in real time by
adjusting the ledger.

4 Applications of Blockchain and Future Trends
4.] Applications

Crosby et a1. (2016) distinguish between ﬁnancial and non-
ﬁnancial applications that could potentially be addressed
by the blockchain (Table 1). This disruptive innovation has
not only the potential to change the nature of interactions in
Finance, but also in many other areas of our everyday life.
For instance, the British singer Imogen Heap sells her
songs using the blockchain.

4.2 Future Trends

The application ﬁelds for blockchains seem to be manifold,
especially in areas that have historically relied on third
parties to establish a certain amount of trust. Atzori (2015)
suggests that politics and the entire society might be
restructured by the blockchain. Many functions might
become obsolete if people started to organize and protect
the society using decentralized platforms He concludes
that “decentralization of government services through
permissioned blockchains is possible and desirable, since it
can signiﬁcantly increase public administration function-
ality”. Reorganizing societies is of prime importance in
poor countries Wealth can be protected more effectively
using the blockchain. Especially in the third world,
landowners have problems to prove the ownership if for
example the local government aims to expropriate the
population. These existential threats can be controlled by
integrating land titles into the blockchain. However, as
pointed out by Glaser (2017), the interface between the
digital realm and the physical world could turn out to be
the weak link which damages the digital trust established
by a blockchain system.

There is also currently a debate among researchers and
regulators if crypto-currencies relying on the blockchain
can fulﬁll the functions of real money (European Central
Bank 2012; Federal Bureau of Investigation 2012). Money
has been deﬁned by Mishkin (2004) as “anything that is
generally accepted in payment for goods or services or in
the repayment of debts”. Luther and White (2014) argue
that today crypto—currencies are only rarely used as a
medium of exchange. Glaser et al. (2014) provide empiri-
cal insights that Bitcoin is indeed primarily used as a
speculative asset. However, spending and accepting might
become easier due to innovative approaches by entrepre-
neurs, establishing crypto-currencies as a substitute for ﬁat
money. The blockchain might therefore contribute to

change the way people pay for goods in the real world.
Homeowners face signiﬁcant transaction costs when buy-
ing property. According to Goldman Sachs, “blockchain
could reduce title insurance premiums and generate $2—
$4 billion in cost savings in the US by reducing errors and
manual effort” (Goldman Sachs 2016).

While computer scientists mainly focus on the techni-
cal and cryptographic challenges in this area, researchers
from the Business and Information Systems Engineering
ﬁeld have the opportunity to focus on market design,
questions of trust and privacy, and the adoption respective
non-adoption of the new technology. Moreover, this dis-
ruptive innovation might change many existing business
models, create new ones and might have severe impacts
on entire industries. Therefore, research at the intersection
of technology, markets and business models is certainly
valuable.
