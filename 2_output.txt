validated by the network using cryptographic means. In
addition to the transactions, each block contains a times-
tamp, the hash value of the previous block (“parent”), and
a nonce, which is a random number for verifying the hash.
This concept ensures the integrity of the entire blockchain
through to the ﬁrst block (“genesis block”). Hash values
are unique and fraud can be effectively prevented since
changes of a block in the chain would immediately change
the respective hash value. If the majority of nodes in the
network agree by a consensus mechanism on the validity of
transactions in a block and on the validity of the block
itself, the block can be added to the chain According to
Swanson (2015), this consensus mechanism “is the process
in which a majority (or in some cases all) of network
validators come to agreement on the state of a ledger. It is a
set of rules and procedures that allows maintaining
coherent set of facts between multiple participating nodes”.
Therefore new transactions are not automatically added to
the ledger. Rather, the consensus process ensures that these
transactions are stored in a block for a certain time (e.g.,
10 min in the Bitcoin blockchain) before being transferred
to the ledger. Afterwards, the information in the blockchain
can no longer be changed. In the case of Bitcoin, blocks are
created by so-called miners who are rewarded with Bit-
coins for validating the blocks. The example of Bitcoin
illustrates that the principle of the blockchain cannot only
change the process of money transactions. Using cryptog-
raphy, people all over the world can trust each other and
transfer different kinds of assets peer-to-peer over the
intemet.

The distributed ledger system described above offers
many beneﬁts. In contrast to centralized systems, the
functionalities of the network persist even if particular
nodes break down. This increases trust since people do not
have to assess the trustworthiness of the intermediary or
other participants in the network, It is sufﬁcient if people
solely build trust in the system as a whole. The absence of
intermediaries also fosters data security. As discussed by
Zyskind et a1. (2015), the current practice of third parties
collecting personal data implies the risk of security brea-
ches. By utilizing the blockchain third parties can become
obsolete, ultimately increasing user’s security.

In computer science, various papers around block-
chains have been published in recent years and have, e.g.,
analyzed consensus algorithms (cg, Eyal and Sirer 2014)
or proposed novel concepts to tackle issues regarding
privacy of smart contracts (e.g., Kosba et al. 2016).
However, besides a lot of industry whitepapers on
blockchains, academic papers in information systems
around blockchain currently primarily focus on crypto-
currencies. Besides signiﬁcant beneﬁts, there are also
drawbacks and potential risks which are discussed in this
stream of literature. Barber et a1. (2012) highlight several
weaknesses of Bitcoin, such as theft or loss of Bitcoins
(malware attacks, accidental loss), scalability issues (e.g,,
delayed transaction conﬁrmation, data retention, and
communication failures), and structural problems (e,g.,
deﬂationary spiral). At the same time, Barber et al. (2012)
suggest solutions for improving the existing Bitcoin
technology. For instance, a “fair exchange protocol”
might improve the user’s anonymity. Privacy implications
of Bitcoin have also been discussed by other authors (e.g.,
Androulaki et a1. 2013; Bonneau et a1. 2014; Miers et al.
2013). In the current Bitcoin world, privacy can only be
protected by using pseudonyms, As an extension to Bit-
coin, Miers et a1. (2013) therefore developed Zerocoin,
which allows for trading cryptocurrencies completely
anonymously. In 2016, ansh, the successor of Zerocoin
was launched.

The process of generating new blocks implies perfor-
mance problems if blocks are added to the network at a
high rate. As an alternative to the existing blockchain
structure, Lewenberg et a1. (2015) introduce “Inclusive
Block Chain Protocols” to increase the transaction speed. It
will be interesting to observe whether performance prob-
lems can be overcome by this new technology, An analysis
regarding the scalability of Bitcoin is provided by Croman
et a1. (2016).
