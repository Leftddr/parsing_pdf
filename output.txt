 However, the financial industry is seen as a primary user of the blockchain concept


 This is not only due to the fact that the most well-known application of this technology is the crypto-currency Bitcoin, but it is also driven by substantial process inefficiencies and a massive cost base issue specifically in this industry


 On top of this, the financial crisis revealed that even in financial services it is not always possible to identify the correct present owner of an asset


 It is even more of a problem to retrace ownership over a longer chain of changing buyers in global  Accepted after one revision by Prof

 It was not possible to clarify the accounting errors and JP Morgan Chase had to bear the damage from excess (digital) shares


 While the problem of tracing back ownership in long transaction chains is already a critical aspect in financial markets, it is also important for physical goods, e.g., (blood) diamonds or broccoli


 US retailer Wal-Mart with more than 260 million customers per week is in search for a technology that helps to identify precisely those batches of vegetables that in a given case, e.g., are infected by coliform bacteria


 Intermediation is today’s dominating solution for verifying ownership of assets and transaction processing


 Intermediaries perform the careful checking of each involved party along a chain of intermediaries


 However, this is not only time consuming and costly but also bears a credit risk in case an intermediary fails


 The blockchain technology promises to overcome these critical aspects, representing ‘‘a shift from trusting people to trusting math’’ (Antonopoulos 2014) since human interventions are no longer necessary

 A blockchain consists of data sets which are composed of a chain of data packages (blocks) where a block comprises multiple transactions (TX1-n, see Fig


 The blockchain is extended by each additional block and hence represents a complete ledger of the transaction history


 Blocks can be  123  184  M

 1 Example of a blockchain (Zheng et al. 2016)  validated by the network using cryptographic means


 In addition to the transactions, each block contains a timestamp, the hash value of the previous block (‘‘parent’’), and a nonce, which is a random number for verifying the hash


 This concept ensures the integrity of the entire blockchain through to the first block (‘‘genesis block’’)


 Hash values are unique and fraud can be effectively prevented since changes of a block in the chain would immediately change the respective hash value


 If the majority of nodes in the network agree by a consensus mechanism on the validity of transactions in a block and on the validity of the block itself, the block can be added to the chain


 According to Swanson (2015), this consensus mechanism ‘‘is the process in which a majority (or in some cases all) of network validators come to agreement on the state of a ledger


 It is a set of rules and procedures that allows maintaining coherent set of facts between multiple participating nodes’’


 Therefore new transactions are not automatically added to the ledger


 Rather, the consensus process ensures that these transactions are stored in a block for a certain time (e.g., 10 min in the Bitcoin blockchain) before being transferred to the ledger


 Afterwards, the information in the blockchain can no longer be changed


 In the case of Bitcoin, blocks are created by so-called miners who are rewarded with Bitcoins for validating the blocks


 The example of Bitcoin illustrates that the principle of the blockchain cannot only change the process of money transactions


 Using cryptography, people all over the world can trust each other and transfer different kinds of assets peer-to-peer over the internet


 The distributed ledger system described above offers many benefits


 In contrast to centralized systems, the functionalities of the network persist even if particular nodes break down


 This increases trust since people do not have to assess the trustworthiness of the intermediary or other participants in the network


 It is sufficient if people solely build trust in the system as a whole


 The absence of intermediaries also fosters data security


 As discussed by Zyskind et al. (2015), the current practice of third parties collecting personal data implies the risk of security breaches


 By utilizing the blockchain third parties can become obsolete, ultimately increasing user’s security


  123  In computer science, various papers around blockchains have been published in recent years and have, e.g., analyzed consensus algorithms (e.g., Eyal and Sirer 2014) or proposed novel concepts to tackle issues regarding privacy of smart contracts (e.g., Kosba et al. 2016)


 However, besides a lot of industry whitepapers on blockchains, academic papers in information systems around blockchain currently primarily focus on cryptocurrencies


 Besides significant benefits, there are also drawbacks and potential risks which are discussed in this stream of literature


 Barber et al. (2012) highlight several weaknesses of Bitcoin, such as theft or loss of Bitcoins (malware attacks, accidental loss), scalability issues (e.g., delayed transaction confirmation, data retention, and communication failures), and structural problems (e.g., deflationary spiral)


 At the same time, Barber et al. (2012) suggest solutions for improving the existing Bitcoin technology


 For instance, a ‘‘fair exchange protocol’’ might improve the user’s anonymity


 Privacy implications of Bitcoin have also been discussed by other authors (e.g., Androulaki et al. 2013; Bonneau et al. 2014; Miers et al. 2013)


 In the current Bitcoin world, privacy can only be protected by using pseudonyms


 As an extension to Bitcoin, Miers et al. (2013) therefore developed Zerocoin, which allows for trading cryptocurrencies completely anonymously


 In 2016, Zcash, the successor of Zerocoin was launched


 The process of generating new blocks implies performance problems if blocks are added to the network at a high rate


 As an alternative to the existing blockchain structure, Lewenberg et al. (2015) introduce ‘‘Inclusive Block Chain Protocols’’ to increase the transaction speed


 It will be interesting to observe whether performance problems can be overcome by this new technology


 An analysis regarding the scalability of Bitcoin is provided by Croman et al. (2016)


  3 Blockchain and Smart Contracts The rise of the blockchain technology in recent years also supports other concepts that have been suggested in  M


 Nofer et al.: Blockchain, Bus Inf Syst Eng 59(3):183–187 (2017)  185  literature


 Szabo (1997) introduced the concept of ‘‘Smart Contracts’’, which combine computer protocols with user interfaces to execute the terms of a contract


 Due to the blockchain, Smart Contracts are becoming more popular since they can be utilized more easily by applying blockchains in comparison to the technology available at the time of their invention 20 years ago


 This innovative approach might, for example, replace lawyers and banks that have been involved in contracts for asset deals depending on predefined aspects (Fairfield 2014)


 Smart Contracts can also be used to control the ownership of properties


 These properties might be tangible (e.g., houses, automobiles) or intangible (e.g., shares, access rights)


 A prominent example for blockchain technology that treats smart contracts as first class citizens is Ethereum, which is a decentralized system originally proposed by Buterin (2014)


 A taxonomy of decentralised consensus systems and an overview of different types of systems is provided  by Glaser and Bezzenberger (2015)


 Ethereum can be seen as an extension of the Bitcoin blockchain to support a broader scope of applications


 Thus, blockchain technology allows to establish contracts using cryptography and to replace third parties (e.g., a notary) that have been necessary to establish trust in the past


 Blockchain might disrupt the entire transaction process by automatically executing contracts in a cost-effective, transparent and secure manner (Fairfield 2014)


 The architectural components of blockchain technology, their interaction as well as a framework for implication analysis of blockchain systems for digital ecosystems is proposed by Glaser (2017)


 The financial industry is even wondering if large parts of their current business might be replaced by the blockchain


 This can be illustrated by the payment process


 If people pay goods by credit card today, the settlement occurs after a delay of several days


 Utilizing the blockchain, this delayed settlement would become  Table 1 Applications of blockchain Type  Application  Description  Examples  Financial applications  Crypto-currencies  Networks and mediums of exchange using cryptography to secure transactions  Bitcoin Litecoin Ripple Monero  Securities issuance, trading and settlement  Companies going public issue shares directly and without a bank syndicate

  change the way people pay for goods in the real world


 Homeowners face significant transaction costs when buying property


 According to Goldman Sachs, ‘‘blockchain could reduce title insurance premiums and generate $2– $4 billion in cost savings in the US by reducing errors and manual effort’’ (Goldman Sachs 2016)


 While computer scientists mainly focus on the technical and cryptographic challenges in this area, researchers from the Business and Information Systems Engineering field have the opportunity to focus on market design, questions of trust and privacy, and the adoption respective non-adoption of the new technology


 Moreover, this disruptive innovation might change many existing business models, create new ones and might have severe impacts on entire industries


 Therefore, research at the intersection of technology, markets and business models is certainly valuable


  4 Applications of Blockchain and Future Trends 4.1 Applications Crosby et al. (2016) distinguish between financial and nonfinancial applications that could potentially be addressed by the blockchain (Table 1)


 This disruptive innovation has not only the potential to change the nature of interactions in Finance, but also in many other areas of our everyday life


 For instance, the British singer Imogen Heap sells her songs using the blockchain


 4.2 Future Trends The application fields for blockchains seem to be manifold, especially in areas that have historically relied on third parties to establish a certain amount of trust


 Atzori (2015) suggests that politics and the entire society might be restructured by the blockchain


 Many functions might become obsolete if people started to organize and protect the society using decentralized platforms


 He concludes that ‘‘decentralization of government services through permissioned blockchains is possible and desirable, since it can significantly increase public administration functionality’’


 Reorganizing societies is of prime importance in poor countries


 Wealth can be protected more effectively using the blockchain


 Especially in the third world, landowners have problems to prove the ownership if for example the local government aims to expropriate the population


 These existential threats can be controlled by integrating land titles into the blockchain


 However, as pointed out by Glaser (2017), the interface between the digital realm and the physical world could turn out to be the weak link which damages the digital trust established by a blockchain system


 There is also currently a debate among researchers and regulators if crypto-currencies relying on the blockchain can fulfill the functions of real money (European Central Bank 2012; Federal Bureau of Investigation 2012)


 Money has been defined by Mishkin (2004) as ‘‘anything that is generally accepted in payment for goods or services or in the repayment of debts’’


 Luther and White (2014) argue that today crypto-currencies are only rarely used as a medium of exchange


 Glaser et al. (2014) provide empirical insights that Bitcoin is indeed primarily used as a speculative asset


 However, spending and accepting might become easier due to innovative approaches by entrepreneurs, establishing crypto-currencies as a substitute for fiat money


 The blockchain might therefore contribute to  123  References Androulaki E, Karame GO, Roeschlin M, Scherer T, Capkun S (2013) Evaluating user privacy in bitcoin
