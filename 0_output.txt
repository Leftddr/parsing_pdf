1 Blockchain — A Disruptive Technology

Blockchain technology and distributed ledgers are attract-
ing massive attention and trigger multiple projects in dif-
ferent industries However, the ﬁnancial industry is seen as
a primary user of the blockchain concept. This is not only
due to the fact that the most well-known application of this
technology is the crypto-currency Bitcoin, but it is also
driven by substantial process inefﬁciencies and a massive
cost base issue speciﬁcally in this industry. On top of this,
the ﬁnancial crisis revealed that even in ﬁnancial services it
is not always possible to identify the correct present owner
of an asset. It is even more of a problem to retrace own-
ership over a longer chain of changing buyers in global

ﬁnancial transaction services: when, e.g., the US invest-
ment bank Bear Stearns failed in 2008 and was completely
acquired by JP Morgan Chase, the number of shares
offered to the acquirer was larger than the shares out-
standing in the books of Bear Stearns. It was not possible to
clarify the accounting errors and JP Morgan Chase had to
bear the damage from excess (digital) shares.

While the problem of tracing back ownership in long
transaction chains is already a critical aspect in ﬁnancial
markets, it is also important for physical goods, e.g.,
(blood) diamonds or broccoli. US retailer Wal-Mart with
more than 260 million customers per week is in search for
a technology that helps to identify precisely those batches
of vegetables that in a given case, e.g., are infected by
coliform bacteria.

lntermediation is today’s dominating solution for veri-
fying ownership of assets and transaction processing.
Intermediaries perform the careful checking of each
involved party along a chain of intermediaries. However,
this is not only time consuming and costly but also bears a
credit risk in case an intermediary fails. The blockchain
technology promises to overcome these critical aspects,
representing “a shift from trusting people to trusting math”
(Antonopoulos 2014) since human interventions are no
longer necessary.

2 Blockchain Functionalities and Implications

A typical example for a blockchain is illustrated in Fig. l.
A blockchain consists of data sets which are composed of a
chain of data packages (blocks) where a block comprises
multiple transactions (TXl-n, see Fig. l), The blockchain
is extended by each additional block and hence represents a
complete ledger of the transaction history. Blocks can be
